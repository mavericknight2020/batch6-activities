                SAN MIGUEL'S RAMON ANG IS BUSY PLANNING THE GROUP'S BIGGEST EXPANSION YET.

                San Miguel’s billionaire president Ramon Ang turned 65 in January, an age when many think about slowing
                down.
                Instead, Ang is busy orchestrating a massive expansion planned as the biggest in the 129-year history of
                the
                Philippine conglomerate. Within five years, he aims to more than double the group’s production capacity,
                which
                in 2017 stood at 19 million hectoliters of beer and 2.6 million tonnes of feed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Our target is to put up 10 new breweries with an initial capacity of 2 million hectoliters each,” says
                Ang
                in a
                rare interview. “On our food expansion, we are on track to finish our 12 brand-new feed mills of 500,000
                annual
                tonne capacity per feed mill by 2023.” Agribusiness expert Rolando Dy at the University of Asia and the
                Pacific
                in Manila sums up the plan simply: “It’s unprecedented.”
